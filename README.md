# Piqued

Piqued is a query compiler for postgres & a language server. The goal of piqued is to enable developers to write queries in a natural (postgres-y) way, while still giving them the full power of typechecking and some of the good functionality an ORM provides.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **This is a work in progress** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Piqued is not even remotely stable. I'm building the boat as I set sail so that I can more easily understand the way it should work. If you want to work on it, I'd love the help but please do not use this for anything real yet.
